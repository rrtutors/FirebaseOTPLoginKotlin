 Authenticate Mobile number and get OTP using Firebase in android studio using kotlin language. When we first use an Android app, we usually have to go through the sign-up process. User's legitimacy can be verified via a variety of methods, including Google, Facebook, Instagram, and others. However, it is highly common among all of these phone or OTP authentications.
